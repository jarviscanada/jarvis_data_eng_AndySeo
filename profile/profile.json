      "description": "Helped the Linux Cluster Administration team to monitor node resource usage (e.g.,CPU,memory) in real time. Wrote bash scripts that will help the LCA team easily set up the postgresql instance, create the database and appropriate tables, and save the usage data into the database. Implemented scripts that can run simultaneously on different machines that will track the usages from multiple machines into one database. Used docker to provision the postgresql instance and the automation process was achieved using crontab.",

Used docker to provision the PostgreSQL instance and and loaded the retail data received from LGS into the PSQL data warehouse. Used a SQL client to explore the data/ write queries. Used Jupyter Notebook for analysis, Pandas library for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualizations and numpy for numerical operations.

  "summary": "I'm a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. During my undergrad, I built a strong foundation in Data Science with statistical/mathematical theories, data concepts, data structures, and machine learning algorithms. This field excites me because data allows us to see the problem from a different perspective and help us identify the underlying problem, which we can implement strategies to overcome that problem. Due to my investigative nature, I find great satisfaction when I extract insights from data. I'm very team-oriented and prioritize punctuality over anything."
